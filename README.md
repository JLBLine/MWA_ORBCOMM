# MWA_ORBCOMM
Holds code for processing raw data out of RF explorers in the ORBCOMM satellite experiment

I've tried to comment everything that needs commenting.

Most useful document is `./documentation/Documentation.md`. Tells you what order to run the code in and what each script is supposed to be doing, referencing it to Line et al. 2018 https://doi.org/10.1017/pasa.2018.30

Good luck
